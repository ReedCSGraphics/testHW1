tetraV2

This is a demonstration of OpenGL and GLUT code
used to render a tetrahedron. This version relies
on specifying the object's geometry as a collection
of triangular facets. It also uses a slicker display
relying on a quaternion-based trackball interface.

To run the demo, enter:

   python3 show.py
