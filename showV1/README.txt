I modified the showV1.

**Please install pillow before running from console:

pip3 install Pillow

My programmer's choice was a height/bump map renderer. You can press space to type in the name of a height map to render a new map (by default the program renders a volcano). Pressing 'w' or 'd' increase/decrease the magnitude of rendered map.
included height maps:

Height maps larger than ~256x256 will probably be too slow to easily view.
