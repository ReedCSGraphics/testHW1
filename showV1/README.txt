showV1

This is a demonstration of OpenGL and GLUT code
used to render a tetrahedron. To render the object
we wrote a function 'drawTetra' that issues a 
series of OpenGL calls, for example, glVertex3f
for specifying each point on the object's facets, 
and glColor3f for specifying the color of each
facet.

To run the demo, enter:

   python3 show.py
